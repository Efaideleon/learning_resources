## Error Handling and Validation

**Anticipate Errors:** Consider potential error scenarios and implement robust error handling mechanisms. Use try-except blocks, error codes, or logging to gracefully handle exceptions.

**Validate Input:** Thoroughly validate user input or data from external sources to prevent unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.
