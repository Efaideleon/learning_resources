# Things to Improve

* It's important to specify parameters for functions
* It's importnat to specify what one class depends on from the other class
* It's importnat to specify the public/private status of the function or variable
* All variables must come from a struct/class and not just be loose and random unless they are local variables. This is specailly true for parameters to functions
